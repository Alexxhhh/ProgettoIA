You are tasked with assigning one unique image to each of the 17 room doors in a virtual environment. Follow these instructions carefully:

1. Image Collection:
Attempt to find and collect 17 relevant images that could be reasonably associated with door signs or symbolic identifiers for rooms. If specific images cannot be found or are unavailable, download 17 random images (they must still be varied and distinguishable).
All images must be saved to the following directory: QUI LA CABBO DI DIRECTORY

2. Image Format:
Accepted formats: .jpg, .png, or .webp. Each image should be named clearly, using the format: door_<room_number>_<short_description>.jpg (Example: door_03_library.png)

3. Image Assignment:
Each image must be assigned to one unique door, corresponding to one of the 17 rooms. Ensure there is a one-to-one match: 17 doors = 17 images.
In your description, specify that the images for each room's door are located in the folder: QUI IL PATH

4. Room Descriptions & Door Panels:
For each of the 17 rooms:
Provide a short description of the room type or purpose.
Describe the door panel design, referencing the image you've assigned (e.g., "The panel displays a stylized book for the library").
Mention the image filename used for the door.

5. Game Rules:

	a. Starting state

		  - Player begins in the `entrance` room.
		  - Player has 3 lives (♥♥♥).
		  - Inventory contains all trap-avoiding items, but no keys.

	b. Movement

   		- Each connected room = one movement button.
    	- If a connection is locked → button is disabled unless the correct key is in inventory.
   		- Using a key consumes (removes) it from inventory.

	c. Traps

	  	- Entering a trapped room requires choosing an item from inventory.
    	- Correct item → trap cleared, continue.
    	-	Wrong item → lose 1 life.

	d. Puzzles

    	- Entering a puzzle room requires answering a question.
    	- Correct answer → puzzle cleared, continue.
    	- Wrong answer → lose 1 life.

	e. Lives

    	- Player starts with 3 lives.
    	- Each wrong trap/puzzle attempt reduces lives by 1.
   		- If lives = 0 → trigger `Game Over` screen and disable input.

	f. Victory condition

    	- Entering the `goal` room → trigger Victory screen and disable input.

Example format for each room:
Room 01 – Library  
Door Panel: Wooden panel with a centered frame displaying an image of a stacked book set.  
Assigned Image: door_01_library.png  
Image Path: PATH

Repeat this format for all 17 rooms, ensuring that no image or room is duplicated.
